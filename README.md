This small MLEfit notebook performs a single and a double exponential fit of data in a histogram. It was created to fit the durations of cellulase enzymes on cellulose fibrils.
It runs by reading the durations on a .csv file and performing the fits using MLE. It provides the p value as a gof. As can be seen a simple exponential does not accurately describe the data, a double exponential decay does however. 
The results are saved in pdf files for easy sharing.
